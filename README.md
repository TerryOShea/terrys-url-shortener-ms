A microservice to convert a url given by the user into a shorter version. 

e.g.: you've entered 'https://www.google.com/' into the input box at 'https://terrys-url-shortener.herokuapp.com/'. 
The app returns '{"long_url":"https://www.google.com/","short_url":"https://url-shortener-ms-terryoshea.c9users.io/1000"}'
(not a very short url, of course, but you can imagine if the main app site were something like 'bit.ly'...)

Then you go to https://url-shortener-ms-terryoshea.c9users.io/1000 and you're redirected to Google.
